Responsive Design.
--------------------

Using html/css to make a website or Layouts adapt to diff screen sizes.

--set viewport
--use media queries
--usng rem units over px
--using fluid widths


Adding the media query
---------------------------

add in the css file.

media qeury is added to make the page responsive to the diff devices.

syntax:

@media(max-width: value)
{
	selector
	{
 		property: value
	}
}
max-width is usually setas 500 px incase of smartphones. since most of phones hav width < 500.

when the page hits the given max-width its background color changes to red.

we can also min-width instead of max-width. it does the opp. of the max-width.
ie. page will be red bg until it hits 500px. and when it hits 500px, it changes to default bg color.





em and rem units
----------------------
em unit

if font size of a parent element is 20px then,
and font of child is specified as 2em, then its computed fontsize will be 40px, that is double of 20px,
it is calculated as 20px * 2 == 40px.
