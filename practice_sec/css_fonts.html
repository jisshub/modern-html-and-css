        <h2>Name</h2><hr>
        <p>The rules of association football were codified in England by the Football Association in 1863 and the name association football was coined to distinguish the game from the other forms of football played at the time, specifically rugby football. <span> The first written "reference to the inflated ball used in the game" was in the mid-14th century: "Þe heued fro þe body went, Als it were a foteballe".[10]</span> The Online Etymology Dictionary states that the "rules of the game" were made in 1848, before the "split off in 1863".[11] The term soccer comes from a slang or jocular abbreviation of the word "association", with the suffix "-er" appended to it.[12] The word soccer (which arrived at its final form in 1895) was first recorded in 1889 in the earlier form of socca.[13]s</p>
