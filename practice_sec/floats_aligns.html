                “Fairy tales are more than true: not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten.”

                “You've gotta dance like there's nobody watching,
                Love like you'll never be hurt,
                Sing like there's nobody listening,
                And live like it's heaven on earth.” 
                ― William W. Purkey

                    Keep trying, hold on, and always, always, always believe in yourself, because if you don't, then who will, sweetie? So keep your head high, keep your chin up, and most importantly, keep smiling, because life's a beautiful thing and there's so much to smile about.”

                    “Listen to the mustn'ts, child. Listen to the don'ts. Listen to the shouldn'ts, the impossibles, the won'ts. Listen to the never haves, then listen close to me... Anything can happen, child. Anything can be.”
