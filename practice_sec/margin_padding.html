    <h1>Cloud Computing</h1>
    <div class="definition">
        <p id="first-para">
                Cloud computing is the the use of various services, such as software development platforms, servers, storage and software, over the internet, often referred to as the "cloud."
        </p>
        <p id="sec-para">
                In general, there are three cloud computing characteristics that are common among all cloud-computing vendors:
                <ol>
                    <li>The back-end of the application (especially hardware) is completely managed by a cloud vendor.</li>
                    <li>A user only pays for services used (memory, processing time and bandwidth, etc.).</li>
                    <li>Services are scalable</li>
                </ol>
        </p>
        <p id="third-para">
                Many cloud computing advancements are closely related to virtualization. The ability to pay on demand and scale quickly is largely a result of cloud computing vendors being able to pool resources that may be divided among multiple clients.

        <p id="cloud-1">
            Some consider cloud computing an overused buzzword that has     been blown out of proportion by marketing departments at large  software firms. A common argument from critics is that cloud     computing cannot succeed because it means that organizations    must lose control of their data, such as an email provider     that stores data in multiple locations around the world.
            Cloud computing proponents point to it being a new paradigm in software development, where smaller organizations have access to processing power, storage and business processes that were once only available to large enterprises.
