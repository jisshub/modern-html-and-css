always name the home page asindex.html
crate a css folder for all our style files.

use semantic tags while cretaing webpages.
such header tag for header of the page ...


use an id for the navbar and put all the stuff in it.
here id is the parent.

after settong the html for navbar lets move to style it.


-- always style the body with, by specifying the html
ie.
html, body{

}


here v need to some padding for header elements.
since v reomov all the margin and padding from athe page.
need to manually specify the spacing.


finally when v stretch our page, v need our navigations 
ars to appear somewhat center of the page,
for that v create container class with in the nav element and place the heading and navigations in it.


if v place the container outside the nav, it affects the background that contains the heading and navbar.
ie background will be restrcited with in the max-width 
of the container. 

ie,
.container
{
    max-width: 1100px;
    margin: auto;
    padding: 10px;
}

so here when v stretch and while it exceed the max width given the heading and navs comes closer to the middle of the page.


next we need to design shocase of the page.

here also v create a container and place all the section
in it. so thus when v strecth the page, contents will be appenared center of the page instead of geting stretched along the page.



style primary-target class
.primary-target
{
    color: #dgajd;
} 

sincce v need to apply this style to other element as well
having class primary-target v didnt spcify h1 for it.


 <!-- next gona do the sections of the page -->

 need to have the backgroud for the section of all the pages as adark.
 so create a ultitiy class for the section.
