--radio type for each radio buttons

Radio buttons are normally presented in radio groups (
    a collection of radio buttons describing a set of related options). 
    Only one radio button in a group can be selected at the same time.

Note: The radio group must have share the same name 
(the value of the name attribute) to be treated as a group. Once the radio group
 is created, selecting any radio button in that group automatically deselects any 
 other selected radio button in the same group. You can have as many radio groups on
  a page as you want, as long as each group has its own name.

Note: The value attribute defines the unique value associated with each radio button. 
The value is not shown to the user, but is the value that is sent to the server on 
"submit" to identify which radio button that was selected.




--checked attribute of input tag to preselect the radio button while page loads


--selected attr ibute of option tag to preselect a value while page loads


--placeholder attribute to initally place default value in the field.

block elevel elements takes full span of the page
and if we put any tags after it will be in next line.
eg: p and div 

inline elements elements does not take full page.
it onlytakes wha its needed.
so if we any thing after inline elements it will shown up right of the inline element
dot take new line
eg: link element <a>
