    /* here rem units depends on root element. ie. default font of an page is 16px.
    and here i set font of box-3 as 20px. and then set font-size of h3 under its parent box-3 as 
    2rem and similarly paragraph p as  2 rem .bt here their font-size will be relative to the root element
     ie. html and not its parent element box-3. ie font-size of box-3 doesnt have asn affect 
     in computing the font of its h3 and p. they depeneds on root element, not parent
     so their font-size wud be 16px * 2  ie 32 px.  */
